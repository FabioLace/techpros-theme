# Techpros-theme
It's a theme for your WP project and it's based on https://wp.ditsolution.net/techpros/

# Shit to know
It's not full integrated with the CMS, becuase most stuff is put via the classical HTML way with the files
I put in the assets folder. BUT, I've left some commentend lines which can be useful if you want to
put your shit. You should install the ACF plugin into your main project beacuse I've used it during the creation of the theme.
